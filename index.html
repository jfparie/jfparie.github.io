                    Hi! I am an applied data scientist with strong societal interests. What fascinates me is the interaction between statistics, data and society. On the intersection of those three discplines, I aim to provide insights by the projects I am working on. Occasionally, I put my two cents in the public debate, please find more information below.

In  this year, I conducted research into AI for Management, i.e., algorithms for decision support. More specifically my research concerned stochastic and causal modelling, e.g., Bayesian data analysis, hidden Markov models and point processes. With applications in:</p>
