Jurriaan Parie (Sneek, 1994) is an all round algorithm expert and co-founder of NGO Algorithm Audit. With a background in mathematics, he explains complex algorithm is simple language. As an AI policy watcher, he unpacks the dilemmas surrounding widespread adoption of advanced technologies.

**From business to non-profit** 

Jurriaan has quit his career in corporate consulting to contribute to a more fair digital future without focussing on profit maximization. With Algorithm Audit he is developing a European knowledge platform for AI bias testing and AI standards. The work of the NGO a read across Europe and beyond.

**Institutional innovation**

Digitalization demands adaptive institutions. From search engines to image detection: new technologies require oversight by parliaments, regulatory authortities and courts â€” many of which lack the necessary expertise. Drawing on his quantitative expertise, Jurriaan bridges the different reasoning paradigms of words and numbers, enhancing the rule of law's ability to govern digitalizing democracies.
